Ludum Dare 21

**August 2011 - Land of Colors**
I remember coding this on the last two days of my summer break, spontaneously.
The theme for the game was "Escape" and we had 48 hours. The entire code is in Java, no libraries used.

**August 2014 - UltraRealistic Moon Wrecking Ball Simulator**
An entry done in short time to the theme of "Connected Worlds". My second LD48 entry ever, was great fun. Pure Java aswell.
This entry lives in its own repository: https://github.com/ZirconCode/LudumDare30
