These are my past LudumDare competition entries.
Hopefully I'll find the time to do more in the future =)


There is only one entry here, so far:

Ludum Dare 21 - August 2011 - Land of Colors
I remember coding this on the last two days of my summer break, spontaneously.
The theme for the game was "Escape" and we had 48 hours.
