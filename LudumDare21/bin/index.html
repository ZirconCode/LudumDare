--------------------------
|   The Land of Colors*	 |
--------------------------
			*colours



Instructions:

	Press spacebar to respawn and go through the story.
	Press m to unmute/mute the awesome music. Music is muted at start.

	Use the WASD keys to move the upper ship
	Use the Arrow keys to move the lower ship

	The ships may not touch black.
	If the ships are not on the same color, your lifebar will drain rapidly.
	Bright green signifies savepoints, white is the end of the level.

	There are three levels, each one grows rapidly more difficult.
	If anyone can complete all three without dying once they shall be proclaimed our hero.

	Enjoy =)

About:

	This is my first Ludum Dare (#21) entry, so be nice =)
	I spent about 16 hours on the first day and 5 on the second.
	Everything is written in Java, all from scratch.
